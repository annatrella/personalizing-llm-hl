How I yearn for the quality of Starbucks' brew@kirchyyy, a bit disappointed but massive kudos on your successful completion of the rock&amp;roll marathon. Absolutely stellar!@jeannysd, after a tech glitch, I had to reboot! Quite a nightmare. By the way, we need to schedule a coding session soon. My tech-savvy heart is yearning.Feeling a bit low. Just arrived here and the guys are about to dive into some coding. I'm not sure I'm up for it, still running on 3 hours of sleep. No quick fix...Just had a sneezing fit... EIGHT times consecutively!!! What on earth?! My allergies are not playing nice.@joanndilay - EXCEPTIONAL!!! I'm totally digging it@jeannysd, I concur! It's dreadful waking up and still feeling the effects of a coding marathonHad a laugh @JeannySD, initially I thought I was misinterpreting your tweet, like I was missing some tech jargon.. turns out, you're just not great at tweeting!

The quest continues!Just completed crafting 10 travel mascots and ran out of stuffing. Time to sew more until I'm ready for another market run.@moonscreations - How's the journey going, Miss Moons? Did the weekend bring any new adventures?@absolutelysmall - It's truly incredible! Rach has a knack for making things extraordinary, not just ordinary.@alexandrakeller - It's fantastic! I'm constantly amazed by the talent in the plush-making community. I feel honored to own their creations.@artransmitte - Yes, I'm on the path to new adventures. Thanks for checking in! How's your day unfolding?@absolutelysmall - I empathize! So many beautiful things to discover, but can't acquire them all. But, the journey will improve!@Blockpartypress - What a supportive partner! Mine assisted me in cleaning my vehicle, and I let him rest while I updated my travel log online.",

I think there's an EU limit...not sure what it is though.Heading back to the studio tomorrow after a week-long break. Not thrilled about it - I know it's going to be the same old song and dance.Monday morning, so many gigs to plan and songs to write after work. Not the best opening act for the week...I need to tune out more and just go with the flow.Just going to drop a beat and say that I'm not feeling it today. It's too beautiful outside to be stuck in the studio and I'm just not in the groove...oh well.Can't catch a signal at the studio. Makes it hard to get any work done. On the bright side, no emails.Definitely feels like I'm back in the studio. It's a harsh reality after a week off and it's way too loud in here. Makes it even harder.Got my usual request at work today 'I want you to create something (don't know what) somewhere by sometime' and I'm like 'can you be more specific please'We're a music company and we can't even get the internet working!! Someone must've unplugged the router again. Not my fault this time.@bullyinguk, Maybe I'm too hard on the ones who are genuinely trying to make a difference and represent their genres well. It's a real shame though.Everything and everyone today seems to be out of tune, trying to throw off my Friday groove. Ugh!",

Adventure is out there, folks! #TravelHumorHey @rperdio @TagAlongTess, I had a pizza night too! Who needs to know what @Tw1sty is up to when there's pizza? #TravelFoodAppreciating the human touch in the Triple J morning news. Even reporters make mistakes. Titanic sank in 2012? #TravelNewsSadly, @tim_butcher isn't on Twitter yet. Meanwhile, the sun isn't shining here in Mornington. #TravelUpdatesNo set date for the next adventure, @hooleydooley. Will keep you posted. #TravelPlansNot a fan of the Gadget Guy on Channel 7, but wouldn't wish him harm. Just not a fan of his shirts. #TravelTVSo, @heidiheartshugs, does this mean you've won the M&amp;Ms competition? #TravelTreats",

What a way to start the day!Watching the luggage handlers load the plane, it's like they're wrestling with my guitar. Maybe I should keep the window shade up.The catering today is fantastic! Pasta with marinara and salad. Here's to healthy eating!",

Remember, kindness is key!@vickybonnett, that's what makes life so diverse and interesting. Every aspect has its own charm.Did I mention it's #followfriday? Give @100monkeysmusic a follow for some great tunes to accompany your workouts.Time to hit the hay! Goodnight, health warriors. Remember, always be true to yourself, no matter how unique you are. Peace out!@Kissyfur85, it's like a 5-in-1 workout! Also, I've shared a new fitness video on YouTube.@vickybonnett, a good sports bra can make all the difference during a workout. For abs like Robbikin, it's all about consistency and dedication.@Kissyfur85, I was watching Rainbow Brite while working out. And hey, every body type is beautiful in its own way.",

More info coming next week.@haraldulriksen That would be a sweet gig, but sadly they're not our instruments.@ds23pallas You should check out Codegarden09.com. They're presenting four ways to do E-commerce with Umbraco on Day 1. It's like a backstage pass to massive research time saving.@warrenbuckley Not sure yet - hopefully we'll record a new track today and then release it next week.@humentech The next big gig will be in June 2010, but hopefully there'll be loads of local jam sessions before then.Had to do a bit of a dirty fix to compensate for a design flaw in our membership implementation... But it's working just fine, like a well-tuned guitar.@improvedk Of course there'll be dead animals, plenty of them. BBQ'ed. It's like a backstage party!",
