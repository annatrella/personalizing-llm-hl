# Personalizing Text Generation via LLMs and Hierarchical Learning
Code for "Personalizing Text Generation via LLMs and Hierarchical Learning" paper. In our paper, we:

1. Create a new dataset: the new "Personalized Tweets" data set found in the data folder [here]().
2. Release code for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for the following tasks:
   * personalized text generation: using supervised fine-tuning [here]() and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [here]()
   * text classification: using supervised fine-tuning
